1. User table: This table would store information about each user, such as their name, email address, and phone number.

2. Shop table: This table would store information about each shop, such as the shop's name, address, and phone number. You may also want to include a field for the shop's hours of operation.

3. Service table: This table would store information about each service offered by the shop, such as the service's name, description, and duration.

4. Appointment table: This table would store information about each appointment made by a user, including the date and time of the appointment, the user who made the appointment, the shop where the appointment is scheduled, and the service that will be provided.

The establish the relationships between these tables, we will use foreign keys.

User -> Appointment: A user can make multiple appointments, so the Appointment table would have a foreign key to the User table.

Shop -> Service: A shop can offer multiple services, so the Service table would have a foreign key to the Shop table.

Service -> Appointment: An appointment is made for a specific service, so the Appointment table would have a foreign key to the Service table.

Shop -> Appointment: An appointment is made at a specific shop, so the Appointment table would have a foreign key to the Shop table.

In terms of attributes, here are some suggestions for each table:

User table: id, name, email, phone_number

Shop table: id, name, address, phone_number, hours_of_operation

Service table: id, name, description, duration

Appointment table: id, date_and_time, user_id (foreign key), shop_id (foreign key), service_id (foreign key)

I hope this helps you get started with your ER diagram!
